(The Account class) Design a class named Account that contains:
- an int data field named id for the account (default 0).
- a double data field named balance for the account (default 0).
- a double data field named annualInterestRate that stores the current
  interest rate (default 0).
- a Date field named dateCreated storing date when account created
- no-arg constructor creating account
- accessor/mutator methods for id, balance, annualInterestRate.
- accessor method for dateCreated
- a method named getMonthlyInterestRate() that returns monthly interest rate
- method named withDraw that withdraws a specified amount from the account.
- a method named deposit that desposits a specified amount to the account

Draw a UML diagram for the class. Implement the class. Write a test program
that creates an Account object with an account ID 1122, a balance of 20000, an
interest rate of 4.5%. Use the withDraw method to withdraw $2500, use the
deposit method to deposit $3000, and print the balance, monthly int rate, and
date account created
