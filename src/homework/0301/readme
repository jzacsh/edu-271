12.2
(Using the BorderLayout manager) Rewrite the preceding program to create the
same user interface, but instead of using FlowLayout fo the frame, use
BorderLayout. Place one panel in the south of the frame and the other panel in
the center.


12.3
(Using the GridLayout manager) Rewrite the preceding program to create the
same user interface. Instead of using FlowLayout for the panels, use a
GridLayout of two rows and three columns.


12.4
(Using JPanel to group buttons) Rewrite the preceding program to create the
same user interface. Instead of creating buttons and panels separately, define
a class that extends the JPanel class. Place three buttons in your panel
class, and create two panels from the user-defined panel class.
