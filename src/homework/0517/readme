Enlarging and shrinking an image
Write an applet that will display a sequence of images from a single image file
in different sizes. Initially, the viewing area for this image has a width of
300px and height of 300px. Your program should continuously shrink the viewing
area by 1 in width and 1 in height until it reaches a width of 50px and a
height of 50px. At that point, the viewing area should continuously enlarge by
1 in width and 1 in height until it reaches a width of 300px and height of
300px. The viewing area should shrink and enlarge (alternately) to create
animation for the single image. Enable the applet ot run standalone.
