(raising flags)
Rewrite Excercise 16.23 [1] using a thread to animate flag rising. Compare the
program with Exercise 16.23 by setting the delay time to 10 in both programs.
Which one runs animation faster?


[1] Exercise 16.23
(Raising flag and playing the anthem)
Create an applet that displays a flag rising up as shown in Figure 14.20 [2].
As the national flag rises, play the national anthem. (you may use a flag image
and anthem audio file from Listing 16.13 [3]).
