10.5
(Enabling Circle comparable) Rewrite the Circle class in Listing 9.2 (pg 304,
attached as ./CircleOld.java ) to extend GeometricObject nad implement the
Comparable interface. Override the equals and hashCode methods in the Object
class. Two Circle objects are equal if their radii are the same. Draw the UML
diagram that involves Circle, GeometricObject, and Comparable.


10.9
(Finding the largest object) Write a method that returns the largest object in
an array of objects. The method signature is:
    public static Object max(Object[] a)

All the objects are instances of the Comparable interface. The order of the
objects in the arra yis determined using the compareTo method.

Write a test program that creats an array of ten strings, and array of ten
integers, an array of ten dates, and finds the largest string, integer, and
date in the arrays.
