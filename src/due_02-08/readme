(The MyPoint class) Design a class named MyPoint to represent a point with x
and y-coordinates. The class contains:
x two data fields x and y that represent the coordinates
x a no-arg constructor that creates a point (0,0)
x a constructor that constructs a point with specified coordinates
x two get methods for data fields x and y, respectively.
x A method named distance that returns the distance from this point to another
  point of the MyPoint type.
x A method named distance that returns the distance from this point to another
  point with specified x and y coordinates.

x Draw the UML diagram for the class.
- Implement the class. Write a test program that creates two points (0,0) and
  (10, 30.5) and displays the distance between them.
